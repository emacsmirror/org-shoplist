# org-shoplist
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lordnik22/org-shoplist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lordnik22/org-shoplist)

An extension on top of org-mode to generate shopping lists, handle recipes and arrange eating-plans. (we talk about guidelines to make delicious food â€” nothing technical).

At the moment you can create shopping lists and have some basic functions for handling recipes.

The focus is to convert conventional recipes(how they are provided by many different websites or books) easly into org-file.
