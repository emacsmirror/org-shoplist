Anything is welcome...at the moment.

Be as native as possible. Implementing features with build-in
functions from build-in packages is prefered. This package uses calc,
org and org-agenda already heavily.

This package is not about trying out a new concepts but rather bring
usefull functionality by building open existing stuff. Mainly around
org.

One exception to these rules is for example transient. Reading
https://github.com/magit/transient/issues/25 makes it likly that
org-agenda-menus will be migrated to transient. In such a case it’s
totaly legitimate to implement a menu with transient even though
org-agenda isn’t quite there yet.
